# MPPT_solar_charge_controller
This project implements a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) solar charge controller using an Arduino Uno. The system uses a buck converter and MPPT algorithm to adjust the duty cycle for extracting maximum power from the solar panel, improving charging efficiency compared to conventional controllers.
